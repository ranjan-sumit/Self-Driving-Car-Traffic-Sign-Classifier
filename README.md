# Self-Driving-Car-Traffic-Sign-Classifier

Traffic road signs are an important part of our road infrastructure. They provide critical
information, and driver has to follow it, as it helps driver to adjust their driving behavior
to make sure they adhere with whatever road regulation currently enforced. Without
such useful signs, we would most likely be faced with more accidents, as drivers would
not be given critical feedback on how fast they could safely go, or informed about road
works, sharp turn, or school crossings ahead. This is really important as many people die
in road accident every year. This number would be much higher without our road signs.
So, it is really important for Autonomous driving car to follow the traffic signal. This
project is one of the important steps towards Autonomous driving car.
Traditionally, there are lots of manual work in classifying traffic signals, to overcome it
we are going implement a deep learning model. We create a model that reliably
classifies traffic signs, learning to identify the most appropriate features for this problem
by itself. 


# Goal of building a Traffic Sign Recognition Project:

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

 Load the data set (see below for links to the project data set)

 Explore, summarize and visualize the data set

 Design, train and test a model architecture

 Use the model to make predictions on new images

 Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images

 Summarize the results with a written report
